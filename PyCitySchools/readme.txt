#pandas-challenge

In this challenge we were tasked with performing an analysis of a city's school district data. 

First, we merged two dataframes containing student data and school data. Then we performed a series of calculations and compiled them into a District Summary which showed student performance for the entire district and a School Summary which showed student performance for individual schools. 

Finally, we used binning and the pd.cut() function to produce additional dataframes that showed school performance based on Spending Per Student, School Size, and School Type (Charter or District).

Help for this code was obtained from Stack Overflow and AskBCS Learning Assistant.
